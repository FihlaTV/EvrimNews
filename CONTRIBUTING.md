# Contributing to EvrimNews
First of all, thanks for your interest in Contributing to EvrimNews üéäüéâ.

We want to remember you that EvrimNews is a private project that you can contribute only for typo fixes. Code fixes are not accepted.
But, if you've fixed a problem on the issue list, you can open a PR so we can check whether it's mergeble, or not.

The reason we limit contributions for this project is that there is a team working on this app. To not interrupt their work, only typo fixes are accepted as mentioned above.

But as mentioned below, if you've fixed anything on the issue list, you can always submit a PR.
